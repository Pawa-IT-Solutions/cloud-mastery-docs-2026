# 4. Visualize Data with Looker Studio

The final step is to unlock the value in our data by creating an interactive dashboard. Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) is a free tool that turns your data into informative, easy to read, and easy to share dashboards.

## Prerequisites

*   A Looker Studio account ([lookerstudio.google.com](https://lookerstudio.google.com)).
*   Your BigQuery table containing data.
*   A [Looker Studio Dashboard Template](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0022c938-4bbb-41ed-a687-0535843f7d40/page/p_uf4yrqljsd){: .external-link target="_blank" rel="noopener" } to copy.

## Step 1: Copy the Dashboard and Connect to Your Data

1.  Open the provided Looker Studio report template.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** and select **Make a copy**.

3.  In the "Copy this report" window, under the **New Data Source** column, click the current data source to change it.
    ![Copy Report - Select New Data Source](assets/images/create-data-source.png)
4.  In the panel that opens, click **CREATE DATA SOURCE** at the bottom.
5.  Select the **BigQuery** connector.
    ![Select BigQuery Connector](assets/images/connect-to-bq.png)
6.  Navigate through the hierarchy: **Your Project** > **`cloud_mastery` Dataset** > **`denormalized_orders` Table**.
7.  Click **CONNECT** in the top-right.
    ![Connect to BigQuery Table](assets/images/click-connect.png)
8.  Looker will show you the table schema. Click **ADD TO REPORT**.
    ![Add to report](assets/images/add-to-report.png)
9.  You'll be back at the "Copy this report" window. Confirm your new data source is selected and click **COPY REPORT**.

Your dashboard copy will now load, powered by your own BigQuery data.

## Step 2: Add a Calculated Field

Let's create a new field directly in Looker Studio without altering our BigQuery table. We'll group detailed order statuses into simpler categories.

1.  In your new report, go to the menu **Resource > Manage added data sources**.
2.  Find your `denormalized_orders` data source and click **EDIT**.
3.  In the top-left of the data source editor, click **+ ADD A FIELD**.
4.  Configure the new field:
    *   **Field Name:** `Order Status Group`
    *   **Formula:**
        ```sql
        -- This formula groups detailed statuses into broader categories.
        CASE
            WHEN status = 'Delivered' THEN 'Completed'
            WHEN status = 'Shipped' THEN 'Completed'
            WHEN status = 'Processing' THEN 'In Progress'
            WHEN status = 'Pending' THEN 'In Progress'
            ELSE 'Other'
        END
        ```
    ![Categories](assets/images/categories.png)
5.  Click **SAVE**. Then click **DONE** in the top-right to return to the report.

## Step 3: Use the Calculated Field in a New Chart

1.  In the top menu, click **Add a chart** and select **Pie chart**.
    ![Add a chart](assets/images/add-new-chart.png)
2.  Click on the report canvas to place the chart.
3.  With the new chart selected, configure its **Setup** panel on the right:
    *   **Dimension:** Drag your new **`Order Status Group`** field here.
    *   **Metric:** Drag the **`order_id`** field here and set its aggregation to **Count Distinct (CTD)**.

4.  Use the **Style** tab in the right-hand panel to customize its appearance.

!!! success "Lab Complete!"
    You have successfully built an end-to-end data pipeline, from raw data in MySQL to an automated data warehouse in BigQuery, and finally to an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio.

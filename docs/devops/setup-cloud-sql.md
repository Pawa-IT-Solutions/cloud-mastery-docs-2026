# Setup Database in Cloud SQL

Next, we need to set up the database to ensure all the necessary data is populated for our application. We will do this by importing a pre-configured SQL file into our Cloud SQL instance.

### Step 1: Navigate to Cloud SQL

1.  Navigate to the Cloud SQL instances page by searching for "Cloud SQL" in the top search bar or by using this direct link:
    [https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)

2.  You should see that a Cloud SQL instance has already been provisioned for you.

### Step 2: Import the Database

1.  Click on the **Instance ID** to open the instance details page.

2.  At the top of the page, click the **IMPORT** button.

3.  On the "Import data" screen, under the **Select source file** section, click **BROWSE**.

4.  A popup window will appear showing your Cloud Storage buckets. Double-click on the bucket name that ends with `-cloud-mastery`.
